                The Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and
                Engineering is accredited by AICTE . The Computer Science and
                Engineering provides students with knowledge of basic and
                advanced topics in all areas of computer science and engineering
                like Data Structures, theory of Computation, Java programming
                and Grid Computing. The students are given through training on
                various Laboratories to have hands on experience. In computer
                science you will study and apply your knowledge in understanding
                what computers are, as how to program them, tools to write a
                program, the rules when converting the written program
                understandable by the computers, the interface between the
                computer and the user, the computer graphics, computer
                networking, managing the software database, software engineering
                and testing them efficiently and more. Now computers are used
                everywhere to reduce the manpower requirements, easy of
                computation and to improve the efficiency. So the scope for
                computer science is endless.

                Today’s civil engineer should possess in depth Civil Engineering
                skills for analysis, design, construction and maintenance of
                various structures, computer, managerial and communication
                skills for better management of various structures. He should be
                also trained to understand and solve real world problems in
                Civil Engineering. There are many career paths for civil
                engineers. Civil engineers can work in Government departments
                (ranging from municipality, corporation, state and central
                governments and defence), public sector undertakings like SAIL,
                GAIL, NTPC, NHPC, BHEL etc. and various private sector
                organizations (contracting and consulting firms). Initially, the
                nature of job may be construction supervision, design, marketing
                or production. As they gain more experience, they manage
