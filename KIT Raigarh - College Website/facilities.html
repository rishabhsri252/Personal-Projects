Networking is a new mode of information sharing among organizations or persons. In the context of library science, Alphonse F. Trezza has defined, Networks as ‘a formal organization among libraries for co-operation and sharing of resources, in which the group as a whole is organized into subgroups of which it is a member’. DELNET has been in operation since January 1988 as a metropolitan area network among Delhi libraries. Later it became ‘Developing Library Network’ enlarging its membership through out the country and even out of India.</p></div>
